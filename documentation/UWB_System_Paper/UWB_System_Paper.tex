  In this paper, we introduce an innovative \ac{UWB} positioning system

  The collected distance measurements are processed by an \ac{EKF} running locally

  relying on the fixed positions of the Anchor boards.}

  \textbf{This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture,

\section{Introduction}\label{section:intro}
Indoor positioning and tracking have gained significant importance in various domains,
including logistics, healthcare, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure.
Traditional positioning systems often face challenges in terms of accuracy, scalability,
and robustness.
To address these issues, we present an \ac{UWB} positioning system that capitalizes
on advanced hardware and sophisticated algorithms,
resulting in an exceptional level of accuracy and reliability.

Our \ac{UWB} system comprises six identical boards,
all based on the ESP32 microcontroller, a versatile and powerful platform known
for its capabilities in wireless communication and processing.
These boards are equipped with \ac{DWM3000} modules from Quorvo,
renowned for their high-performance UWB capabilities.

One of these boards is designated as the ''Tag'',
responsible for initiating \ac{TWR} measurements with the remaining five ''Anchor'' boards.
The innovative aspect of our system lies in its ability to perform accurate localization
without reliance on external infrastructure or centralized processing.

The heart of our UWB system is the \ac{EKF} implemented locally on the Tag board.
This EKF takes the distance measurements obtained from TWR with the Anchor boards and,
based on their known fixed positions, computes the real-time position of the Tag board
with remarkable precision.
This decentralized approach not only ensures rapid and reliable positioning but also
offers scalability, making it suitable for various applications where real-time location
data is crucial.

In this paper, we will delve into the details of our \ac{UWB} system,
explaining the hardware setup as well as the firmware architecture.
