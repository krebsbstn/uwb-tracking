Another way to obtain the current position of the tag is via MQTT. 
To utilize this feature it is necessary to put the WiFi SSID and Password, as well as the IP address of the device hosting the MQTT server into all the involved devices. 
This is done by changing the parameters in the respective source code and flashing all UWB devices.
