\section{BleConfigWidget}

The BleConfigWidget is a specialized widget in your dashboard application designed to interact with the tag device, retrieve configuration data from it, and update the configuration remotely. 

In order to view the current configuration and change it, go through the following steps.

	\item Select the "ESP32" device from the device list right to the Refresh button. 
	\item Hit the "Connect" button. After a short time the saved coordinates for each anchor device start to appear in the corresponding text fields. 
	\item To change the coordinates, define them in your setup physical by measuring thei position in relation to the origin (0,0,0). 
	\item Simpy change the already displayed coordinates. once the system noticed a change in a certain value the cell will change its color to red. 
	\item Once you are finished reconfigurating you need to hit the "Upload" button below the displayed coordinates to transfer the new values to the tag device.

\section{BlePlotPositionWidget}

The BlePlotPositionWidget lets you display the current position of the tag in the choosen coordinate system.

	\item Select the "ESP32" device from the device list right to the Refresh button. 
	\item Hit the "Connect" button. After a short time the saved coordinates for each anchor device. 
	\item Now in the given plot of the widget a dot with the current estimated position is added. 
\end{enumerate}
