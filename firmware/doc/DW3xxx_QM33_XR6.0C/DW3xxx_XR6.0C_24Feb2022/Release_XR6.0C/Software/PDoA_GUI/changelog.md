Release 1.0 (15 Mar 2021)
Initial release
Known issues:
1) Use IMU tickbox and changing the ranging rate sometimes doesn’t work. Unjoining the Tag and joining it back helps.
1) MiniMap doesn’t show the boundaries correctly
2) Not every picture format can be loaded as a floorplan (png usually work, jpg don’t)
