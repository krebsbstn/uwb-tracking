# UWB-Ranging-Based Tracking Technology
This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for the development of a Tracking Technology based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Ranging. The project is part of the Master of Electrical Systems and aims to create a system that can accurately track the movement of mobile tags in indoor environments.

The project uses UWB technology to measure the distance between a set of anchors and a wearable device carried by the user. The system then uses this data to estimate the user's position and trajectory, which can be displayed in real-time on a map or other visualization tool.

The repository includes the following components:

* Firmware for the anchors and the wearable device
* Software for data processing
* Documentation, including system requirements, design specifications, test plans, and user manuals
* Test data and results, as well as scripts for testing and validation
* Other resources, such as schematics, PCB layouts, and 3D models

The code and documentation are organized in a clear and consistent manner, with comments and instructions to facilitate understanding and reuse by others.

Overall, this repository represents a significant effort to develop a UWB-Ranging-based Trekking Technology that can improve safety, navigation, and adventure experiences in indoor environments. The project has practical and academic value.
